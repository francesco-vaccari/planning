For limits: literal goal index 0, fact (content_at_location_at_workstation tool loc1 wor1), is static or a precondition
For limits: literal goal index 1, fact (content_at_location_at_workstation valve loc2 wor2), is static or a precondition
For limits: literal goal index 2, fact (content_at_location_at_workstation valve loc5 wor5), is static or a precondition
